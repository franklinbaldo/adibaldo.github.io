## 2026-02-12 - Calendar Verification in Future-Dated Posts
**Learning:** When fact-checking religious calendars (e.g., Jewish Year), always calculate relative to the post's intended publication date, not the current date, to avoid flagging correct future dates as errors.
**Action:** Check frontmatter pubDate before verifying time-sensitive data.

## 2026-02-12 - Historical Misconceptions: Favelas and Scapegoats
**Learning:** Common historical narratives often simplify origins. The term "favela" is specifically tied to the Canudos War (1897) and the plant "faveleira", not merely urban displacement like the arrival of the Royal Court (1808). Similarly, the term "scapegoat" (bode expiatório) originates from the Leviticus ritual (Day of Atonement), distinct from the Binding of Isaac (where a ram was sacrificed).
**Action:** Always verify the etymology and specific historical context of terms, even when they seem intuitively connected to famous events.
