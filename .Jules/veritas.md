## 2026-02-13 - Mithras vs Sol Invictus: A Persistent Conflation
**Learning:** The claim that December 25 was chosen because it was "the birthday of Mithras" is one of the most widespread misattributions in popular history writing. The historical evidence links December 25 to the Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (Birthday of the Unconquered Sun), established by Emperor Aurelian in 274 CE. While Mithras was sometimes given the epithet "Sol Invictus" in inscriptions, the two cults were distinct, and there is no primary evidence that Mithras' birthday was celebrated on December 25.
**Action:** When encountering claims about pagan origins of Christmas dates, always distinguish between Sol Invictus (Roman state cult) and Mithras (mystery religion with Iranian origins). Cross-reference with Roger Beck's Mithraic scholarship and the Calendar of Philocalus (354 AD).
