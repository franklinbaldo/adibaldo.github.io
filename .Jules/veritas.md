## 2026-02-12 - [Portuguese Biblical Anachronisms]
**Learning:** Common linguistic confusion in Portuguese between "funda" (sling) and "estilingue" (slingshot). "Estilingue" refers to a rubber-powered weapon (post-1839), while "funda" is the ancient centrifugal weapon used by David. Many authors use them interchangeably.
**Action:** Always flag "estilingue" in ancient contexts as an anachronism and suggest "funda".
