## 2026-02-14 - Sol Invictus vs Persian Origin
**Learning:** The Roman festival of Sol Invictus (Dec 25) is frequently conflated with the Persian god Mithras. While Mithras has Persian origins, the 'Sol Invictus' state cult established by Aurelian was Roman.
**Action:** Verify attributions of 'Sol Invictus' carefully; if attributed to Persians, correct to Roman or clarify the distinction.
